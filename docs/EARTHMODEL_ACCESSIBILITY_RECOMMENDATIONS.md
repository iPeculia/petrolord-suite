# Accessibility Recommendations

## Immediate
*   Add `aria-label` to all icon-only buttons (completed for Top Nav).
*   Ensure all form inputs in Settings have associated `<Label>`.

## Short-term
*   Implement "Skip to Content" link for keyboard users.
*   Provide data-table alternatives for all major charts (Log Viewer, Crossplot).

## Long-term
*   Develop a "Low Motion" mode that disables all heavy animations globally (partially implemented in Display Settings).
