# Help Center Best Practices

## Content Writing
- **Clarity:** Use simple, direct language. Avoid jargon where possible, or link to the Glossary.
- **Structure:** Use Headers (H1, H2) to break up text.
- **Action-Oriented:** Focus on *how* to do things (e.g., "Click the button" vs "The button is used for...").
- **Visuals:** Reference UI elements by their exact name in bold (e.g., **Save Project**).

## Organization
- **Categorization:** Keep articles in logical buckets. Do not exceed 7 items per category if possible.
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Start with "Basics" articles before "Advanced" workflows.

## Accessibility
- **Alt Text:** Describe images for screen readers.
- **Contrast:** Ensure screenshots have high contrast or are annotated clearly.
- **Keyboard:** Ensure all Help Center navigation is accessible via keyboard.

## Updates
- Review content quarterly.
- Update `lastUpdated` date whenever content changes to signal freshness to users.
