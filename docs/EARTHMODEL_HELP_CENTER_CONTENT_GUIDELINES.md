# Help Center Content Guidelines

## Tone and Voice
*   **Professional yet Accessible:** Use clear, concise technical language.
*   **Active Voice:** "Click the button" (Good) vs "The button should be clicked" (Bad).
*   **Objective:** Focus on facts and workflows.

## Article Structure
1.  **Title:** Clear and action-oriented (e.g., "How to Create a Grid").
2.  **Introduction:** 1-2 sentences explaining *what* the feature is and *why* use it.
3.  **Prerequisites:** What data or setup is needed before starting.
4.  **Step-by-Step Instructions:** Numbered list of actions.
5.  **Troubleshooting/Tips:** Common pitfalls or pro-tips.
6.  **Related Links:** Links to other relevant articles.

## Formatting
*   **Bold:** Use for UI elements (buttons, menus, field names). Example: Click **Save**.
*   **Code Blocks:** Use for scripts, formulas, or file paths.
*   **Images:** Include screenshots for complex steps. Always add Alt Text.
*   **Callouts:** Use blockquotes or alert boxes for warnings and critical notes.

## Maintenance
*   **Review Cycle:** Content should be reviewed every 3 months or upon every major release.
*   **Versioning:** If a feature changes significantly, update the article or create a version-specific variant.
