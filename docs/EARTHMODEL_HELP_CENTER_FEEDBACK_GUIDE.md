# Feedback System Guide

## Overview
The feedback mechanism allows users to rate the utility of help articles, providing direct signals for content quality.

## Types of Feedback
1.  **Binary Rating:** "Was this helpful? Yes/No".
2.  **Implicit Signals:** Time spent on page, scroll depth.
3.  **Explicit Contact:** "Contact Support" form submissions.

## Handling Negative Feedback
When an article receives multiple "No" votes:
1.  **Flag:** The article is flagged in the admin dashboard.
2.  **Review:** Content team reviews the article for clarity, accuracy, and freshness.
3.  **Update:** Article is revised.
4.  **Reset:** Feedback counter for that version is reset.

## Feature Requests
Feedback often contains feature requests disguised as "how-to" questions. These should be tagged and forwarded to the Product Team.
