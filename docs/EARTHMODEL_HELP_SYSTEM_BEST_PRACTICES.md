# Help System Best Practices

*   **Be Specific**: When searching, use specific terms like "Seismic Attribute Extraction" rather than just "Seismic".
*   **Use Context**: Open help from *within* the tool you are using. The system prioritizes relevant articles.
*   **Check Videos**: For complex 3D interactions, video tutorials are often clearer than text.
*   **Contribute**: If you find a workaround, post it in the Community Forum to help others.
