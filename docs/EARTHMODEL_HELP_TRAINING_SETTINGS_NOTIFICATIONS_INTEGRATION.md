# Integration Guide: Support & Notification Systems

## Inter-System Connectivity

1.  **Help <-> Training**:
    *   When a user searches Help for a broad topic (e.g., "Geomechanics"), the search results now suggest relevant **Training Courses** alongside articles.

2.  **Settings <-> Notifications**:
    *   Notification preferences are stored in the centralized Settings module but queried by the Notification delivery engine in real-time.

3.  **Notifications <-> Help**:
    *   Error notifications now include a "Troubleshoot" link that directly opens the relevant Help Article for that error code.

4.  **Training <-> Profile**:
    *   Earned certifications are automatically displayed on the User Profile and visible to Team Admins.
