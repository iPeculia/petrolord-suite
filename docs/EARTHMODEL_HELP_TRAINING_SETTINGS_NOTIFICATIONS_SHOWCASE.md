# Feature Showcase

## 1. Help System
*   **Contextual Genius**: Hover over any complex geological parameter, and a smart tooltip doesn't just define it—it links to a 30-second video explainer.
*   **AI Assistant**: "How do I calculate STOIIP?" The chatbot gives you a step-by-step guide instantly, citing the official documentation.

## 2. Training System
*   **Career Paths**: New hires aren't just given a tool; they are given a roadmap. "Junior Geologist" path takes them from basic navigation to complex fault modeling.
*   **Interactive Labs**: Don't just watch—do. The Sandbox Mode lets users practice well planning on dummy data without risk.

## 3. Settings System
*   **My EarthModel**: Users can customize density, theme, and layout. A reservoir engineer might prefer a data-dense spreadsheet view, while a manager wants a spacious dashboard.
*   **Integration Hub**: A visual graph showing how EarthModel connects to Petrel, SAP, and Excel, with health status indicators.

## 4. Notification System
*   **Smart Noise Filtering**: Instead of 50 emails for 50 sensor spikes, get one "Cluster Alert: 50 anomalies detected in Well A".
*   **Actionable Alerts**: Notifications aren't just text. Click "Approve" directly on a "Budget Approval Request" toast without leaving your current screen.
