*   **Skill Assessments**: Interactive quizzes to gauge proficiency levels in different modules (e.g., Petrophysics, Geomechanics) and recommend suitable courses.
*   **Learning Paths**: Curated sequences of courses designed for specific roles (e.g., "Junior Geologist Path", "Reservoir Engineer Path").
*   **Gamification**: Achievement badges and leaderboards to motivate continuous learning.
*   **Peer Learning**: Tools for users to form study groups and collaborate on training exercises.
*   **Instructor-Led Training**: Scheduling and access to live virtual or in-person training sessions.
*   **Training Analytics**: For team leads to monitor the skill development and course completion rates of their teams.
*   **Certification Programs**: Formal exams that grant recognized credentials upon passing, validating expertise in EarthModel Pro.
*   **Interactive Workshops**: Hands-on simulation environments where users practice workflows on sandbox data with real-time feedback.

## 3. Settings System
The Settings System provides granular control over the application environment, user preferences, and system configurations.

*   **General & Display**: Configuration of language, time zones, units of measurement (Metric/Imperial), themes (Dark/Light), and UI density.
*   **Notifications**: Fine-tuned controls for which events trigger alerts and through which channels (In-app, Email, SMS).
*   **Data Management**: Settings for local caching, auto-save frequency, default storage locations, and backup schedules.
*   **Performance**: Toggles for hardware acceleration, render quality (LOD), and memory usage limits for large datasets.
*   **Security**: Password management, active session review, Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) setup, and API token generation.
*   **Integrations**: Connection manager for third-party tools (Petrel, Techlog, SAP, external databases) and cloud storage providers.
*   **User Profile**: Management of professional details, avatars, and contact info.
*   **Workspace & Collaboration**: Settings for default project templates, sharing permissions, and team roles.
*   **Automation**: Configuration of rules for automated tasks (e.g., "Run daily backup", "Alert on drilling anomaly").
*   **Plugins**: Management interface for installing and updating optional modules and extensions.

## 4. Notification System
The Notification System ensures users stay informed about critical events, project updates, and system status.

*   **Notification Center**: A dedicated panel listing all past and present notifications, with filtering by type (Error, Info, Success) and date.
*   **Real-time Alerts**: Toast notifications for immediate feedback on actions (e.g., "Save Successful", "Calculation Failed").
*   **Smart Grouping**: Logic to bundle similar notifications (e.g., "5 new comments on Well A") to prevent alert fatigue.
*   **Rules Engine**: User-definable rules to trigger notifications based on data thresholds (e.g., "Notify me if Pore Pressure exceeds 12 ppg").
*   **Multi-channel Delivery**: Support for delivering notifications via in-app UI, email digest, SMS, or webhooks to platforms like Slack/Teams.
*   **Do Not Disturb**: Controls to mute non-critical notifications during specific hours or when in "Focus Mode".
*   **Analytics**: Insights into notification volume and user engagement (open rates) to help admins optimize communication.
