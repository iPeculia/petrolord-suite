# EarthModel Pro Navigation Guide

## Navigation Overview
EarthModel Pro uses a dedicated application mode that hides the standard dashboard sidebar to maximize screen real estate for modeling.

## Back to Dashboard
To return to the main Geoscience Dashboard:
1.  **Header Button:** Click the "Back to Dashboard" button located in the top-left corner of the EarthModel Pro header.
2.  **Keyboard Shortcut:** Press `Alt + B` at any time.

## Module Navigation
-   **Sidebar:** Use the collapsible sidebar on the left to switch between modeling domains (Structural, Property, etc.).
-   **Tabs:** Within each module, use tabs to access specific tools (e.g., Facies vs. Petrophysics).

## State Management
-   The application attempts to save your context (active module, camera position) when navigating away, but it is recommended to explicitly save your project (`Ctrl + S`) before leaving EarthModel Pro.
