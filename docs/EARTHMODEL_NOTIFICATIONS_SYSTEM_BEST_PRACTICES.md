# Notification Best Practices

*   **Avoid Noise**: Do not enable email notifications for high-frequency events (like real-time sensor updates). Use In-App or Digest instead.
*   **Critical Channels**: Reserve SMS/PagerDuty integrations strictly for critical safety or operational halts.
*   **Clean Up**: Periodically review and delete old custom rules that are no longer relevant to current operations.
