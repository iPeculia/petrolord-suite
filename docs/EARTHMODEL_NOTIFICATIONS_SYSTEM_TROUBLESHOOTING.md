# Notifications Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **No desktop push alerts** | Browser permissions denied. | Click "Lock" icon in URL bar -> Reset Permissions -> Allow Notifications. |
| **Delayed Emails** | SMTP queue backlog. | Check status page. Usually resolves automatically. |
| **False Alarms** | Rule threshold too tight. | Adjust rule logic (e.g., increase duration or value limits). |
