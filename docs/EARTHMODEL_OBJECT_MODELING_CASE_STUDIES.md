# Case Studies: Object Modeling

## Case Study 1: West Africa Turbidites
*   **Challenge**: Connecting thin, high-perm channel sands in a mud-rich background.
*   **Solution**: Used Object Modeling with "Compensational Stacking" rules.
*   **Result**: Improved history match of water breakthrough times compared to previous SIS models which smeared the sands.

## Case Study 2: Fluvial System
*   **Challenge**: Predicting sand body orientation in a sparsely drilled area.
*   **Solution**: Conditioned channel object orientation to seismic attribute trends (spectral decomposition).
*   **Result**: Successful placement of an appraisal well in the channel axis.
