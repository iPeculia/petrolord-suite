# Release Notes: EarthModel Pro v4.0 (Object & Petro)

## New Features
*   **Object Modeling Hub**: A dedicated workspace for defining stochastic bodies.
*   **Interactive 3D Editor**: Drag-and-drop object placement.
*   **Petrophysics Hub**: Advanced log analysis and rock physics.
*   **Cross-Plotter**: High-performance scatter plots with regression tools.
*   **Gassmann Fluid Substitution**: Interactive "what-if" scenarios for 4D seismic.

## Improvements
*   **Unified 3D Engine**: Facies, Properties, and Objects now share the same React-Three-Fiber rendering engine for consistent visualization.
*   **Performance**: Optimized log rendering for long laterals.

## Known Issues
*   Fault block clipping in the 3D view may be imperfect for complex fault networks (visual only).
*   Monte Carlo uncertainty runs limited to 100 iterations in the web client.
