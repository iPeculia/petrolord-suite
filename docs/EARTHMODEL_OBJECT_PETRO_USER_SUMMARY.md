# User Summary

Welcome to the new **Object Modeling** and **Petrophysics** modules in EarthModel Pro!

**For Geologists:**
You now have a powerful tool to model complex sedimentary bodies. Move beyond simple layer-cake models. Build channels, lobes, and diapirs that look and behave like the real earth.

**For Petrophysicists:**
No more switching tools. Perform your log QC, interpretation, and rock physics modeling right here. Then, seamlessly push your porosity and saturation models into the 3D grid for volume calculation.

**For Engineers:**
The resulting static models are more geologically realistic, leading to better dynamic simulation results and more reliable forecasting.
