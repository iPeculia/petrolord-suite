# Best Practices: Petrophysics

*   **Bad Hole Flag**: Always apply a caliper cutoff or DRHO correction to remove washed-out zones before analysis.
*   **Zoning**: Do not apply a single property transform to the whole field. Zone by stratigraphy and facies.
*   **Variable Density**: Don't assume constant fluid density. It changes with pressure/temperature (depth).
*   **Cutoffs**: Net Pay cutoffs (Vsh < 50%, Phi > 8%) are arbitrary. Run sensitivities on them.
*   **Units**: Be extremely careful with units. Permeability in mD vs Darcy. Depth in meters vs feet. Density in g/cc vs kg/m³.
