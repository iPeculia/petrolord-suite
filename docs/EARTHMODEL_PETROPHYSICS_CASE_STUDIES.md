# Case Studies: Petrophysics

## Case Study 1: Low Resistivity Pay
*   **Challenge**: High water saturation calculated in productive sands due to conductive minerals (Pyrite/Clay).
*   **Solution**: Switched from Archie to Waxman-Smits model to account for clay conductivity.
*   **Result**: Identified 20m of additional net pay, validated by testing.

## Case Study 2: 4D Seismic Feasibility
*   **Challenge**: Assessing if water injection would be visible on seismic.
*   **Solution**: Performed Gassmann fluid substitution (Oil -> Water).
*   **Result**: Showed a 4% change in Acoustic Impedance, deemed detectable with high-repeatability seismic.
