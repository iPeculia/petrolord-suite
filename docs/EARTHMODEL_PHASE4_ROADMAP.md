# EarthModel Pro - Phase 4 Roadmap & Beyond

## Phase 4 (Current) - "The Intelligent Earth"
**Focus**: Core ML infrastructure, basic prediction, and optimization.
*   ✅ ML Hub & Registry
*   ✅ Facies Prediction (Random Forest/XGBoost)
*   ✅ Property Prediction (Regression)
*   ✅ Well Placement Optimization (Genetic Algo)
*   ✅ BasinFlow Genesis ML Integration (Auto-Calibration)

## Phase 5 (Next) - "Collaborative Intelligence"
**Focus**: Team-based ML, deep learning for seismic, and real-time streams.
*   🗓️ **Deep Learning for Seismic**: CNNs for fault and horizon tracking.
*   🗓️ **Federated Learning**: Train models across secure organizational boundaries.
*   🗓️ **Real-time Anomaly Detection**: Monitor drilling streams (RTO) for kicks/losses using LSTM.
*   🗓️ **Natural Language Interface**: "Ask the data" query capability.

## Phase 6 (Future) - "Autonomous Operations"
**Focus**: Closed-loop control and generative AI.
*   🚀 **Generative Reservoir Modeling**: GANs for creating geologically realistic realizations.
*   🚀 **Autonomous Well Control**: AI-driven recommendations for closed-loop drilling rigs.
*   🚀 **Digital Twin Perfection**: Real-time synchronization between physical assets and digital models.
