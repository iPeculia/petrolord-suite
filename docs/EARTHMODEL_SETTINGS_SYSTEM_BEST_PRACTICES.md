# Settings Best Practices

*   **Organization Level**: Admins should set defaults at the Organization level to ensure consistency across all projects.
*   **Least Privilege**: When inviting users, grant the lowest necessary permission level initially.
*   **Regular Audits**: Review active API keys and sessions monthly. Revoke unused ones.
*   **Backups**: While EarthModel Cloud handles backups, configuring regular exports of critical project files to local storage is a good secondary safety measure.
