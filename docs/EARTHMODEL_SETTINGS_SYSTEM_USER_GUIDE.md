The Settings Panel is the control center for your EarthModel Pro experience. Access it via the **Gear Icon** in the header.

## 2. Key Configurations

*   **Units**: Set project default to Metric (m, kg/m³) or Field (ft, ppg). Note: This can be overridden per project.

### Display
*   **Theme**: Toggle Dark Mode (recommended for interpretation) or Light Mode.
*   **Density**: "Compact" allows more data rows on screen; "Comfortable" adds whitespace.

### Performance

### Notification Preferences
