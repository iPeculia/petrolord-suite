# Training Best Practices

*   **Sequential Learning**: Do not skip foundational modules. Advanced courses assume prior knowledge.
*   **Hands-on**: Keep EarthModel Pro open in another window. Try to replicate the tutorial steps immediately.
*   **Retake Quizzes**: If you barely pass, consider reviewing the material again. Mastery is better than completion.
*   **Schedule Time**: Block out 1 hour/week on your calendar dedicated to training to ensure consistent progress.
