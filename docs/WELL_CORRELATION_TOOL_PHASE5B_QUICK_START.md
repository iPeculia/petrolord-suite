# PHASE 5B QUICK START GUIDE
**Topic:** State Management & Persistence

## What is Phase 5B?
Phase 5B focuses on implementing robust state management, persistence, and data integrity for the Well Correlation Tool. It ensures data is safe, consistent, and recoverable across user sessions.

## Key Objectives
*   Complete `WellCorrelationContext`.
*   Implement `localStorage` persistence.
*   Implement data validation and error recovery.
*   Add state synchronization and consistency checks.

## Main Tasks

### Task 1: Complete WellCorrelationContext
*   Implement all state properties and actions.
*   Add state validation and error handling.

### Task 2: Implement localStorage Persistence
*   Save/Load state from `localStorage`.
*   Handle quota errors and data versioning.

### Task 3: Implement Data Validation
*   Validate well, marker, horizon, and project data.

### Task 4: Implement Error Recovery
*   Handle corrupted data and missing files.
*   Implement recovery strategies.

### Task 5: Add State Synchronization
*   Sync state across tabs/windows.
*   Handle concurrent updates.

### Task 6: Add Data Consistency Checks
*   Check integrity and referential consistency.
*   Provide consistency reports.

## Success Criteria
*   All state properties initialized and actions implemented.
*   `localStorage` persistence working.
*   Data validation and error recovery complete.
*   State synchronization and consistency checks active.
*   All tests passing.
*   Documentation complete.

## Timeline
*   **2-3 weeks**

## Next Steps
*   Start with Task 1: Complete `WellCorrelationContext`.
*   Proceed to Task 2: Implement `localStorage` persistence.
*   Follow with validation, recovery, sync, and consistency checks.
