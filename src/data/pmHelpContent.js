      <h2>Welcome to the Future of Project Management</h2>
      <p>Project Management Pro is an integrated suite designed for the energy sector. It combines traditional project management disciplines with industry-specific workflows for Exploration, Appraisal, Development, and Decommissioning.</p>
      <h3>Key Capabilities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lifecycle Management:</strong> Track projects from Concept to Close-out.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrated Analytics:</strong> Real-time dashboards for Budget, Schedule, and Risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Advanced risk matrices and Monte Carlo simulations.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Planning:</strong> Capacity planning and resource allocation tools.</li>

    content: `
      <p>The system is divided into three main operational areas:</p>
      <h3>1. The Portfolio Dashboard</h3>
      <p>This is your command center. It provides a high-level view of all active projects, aggregated KPIs, and portfolio health status. Use this to identify outliers and allocate capital efficiently.</p>
      <h3>2. Project Workspace</h3>
      <p>Where the work gets done. Each project has its own dedicated workspace containing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gantt Chart:</strong> For schedule management.</li>
        <li><strong>Kanban Board:</strong> For task execution.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk Register:</strong> For identifying and mitigating threats.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Plan:</strong> For staffing and cost estimation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>3. Analytics & Reporting Hub</h3>
      <p>Generate detailed PDF reports, view cumulative cost trends (S-Curves), and analyze Earned Value Management (EVM) metrics.</p>

      <p>Tasks are the building blocks of your project. You can manage them in three views:</p>
      <h3>WBS View (Work Breakdown Structure)</h3>
      <p>Best for bulk editing and structuring. Use the table view to quickly add tasks, set dates, and assign owners. Use the arrow buttons to reorder tasks.</p>
      <h3>Gantt Chart</h3>
      <p>Best for visualizing timelines and dependencies. Drag and drop bars to adjust dates. Dependencies are visualized as connecting lines.</p>
      <h3>Kanban Board</h3>
      <p>Best for execution. Drag cards between "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done" to update status instantly.</p>
