# EarthModel Studio Analytics & Reporting

## Overview
Phase 9 introduces comprehensive analytics capabilities to EarthModel Studio, empowering users to derive deeper insights from their data and project activities.

## Components

### 1. Dashboard Analytics
- **Real-time Metrics**: View active session stats, total asset counts, and performance indices.
- **Visualizations**: Pie charts for asset distribution and line charts for system load.

### 2. Report Builder
- **Custom Reports**: Generate PDF summaries of your project status.
- **Configurable Content**: Toggle charts, tables, and map snapshots on/off.
- **Templates**: Choose between Executive Summary, Technical Detail, and Data Audit formats.

### 3. Advanced Analysis Tools
- **Data Quality**: Automated checks for schema compliance and missing data.
- **Trend Analysis**: Visualize historical data patterns (e.g., production forecasts).
- **Anomaly Detection**: AI-assisted flagging of data outliers (e.g., log spikes).
- **Comparison**: Side-by-side evaluation of wells and horizons (placeholder).

## How to Use

1. **Access**: Click the "Analytics" tab in the main studio navigation (if enabled).
2. **Tracking**: User interactions are automatically tracked in the background.
3. **Exporting**: Use the Report Builder to download PDFs.

## Best Practices
- **Regular Audits**: Run the Data Quality check before finalizing any interpretation.
- **Performance**: Monitor the "Avg Load Time" metric if the application feels sluggish; large datasets may need optimization.
