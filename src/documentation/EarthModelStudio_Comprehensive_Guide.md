# EarthModel Studio: Comprehensive Guide

## Overview
EarthModel Studio is a comprehensive, web-based subsurface modeling platform integrated into the Petrolord ecosystem. It unifies geophysical, geological, and petrophysical analysis into a single environment.

## Key Modules

### 1. Base Ecosystem (Phases 1 & 2)
- **3D Window**: Interactive visualization of wells, horizons, faults, and seismic volumes using WebGL.
- **Map View**: Geospatial context with production data overlays.
- **Cross Section**: Traditional 2D correlation panels.

### 2. Well Correlation (Phase 3)
- **Ghost Curve Matching**: Interactive well log alignment.
- **AI Tops Picking**: Automated stratigraphy detection.
- **Fence Diagrams**: Multi-well correlation visualization.

### 3. Seismic Analysis (Phase 4)
- **Seismic Viewer**: Native SEG-Y support with spectrum analysis.
- **Interpretation**: Horizon and fault picking tools.
- **Synthetics**: Seismic-to-well tie functionality.

### 4. Structural Framework (Phase 5)
- **Fault Modeling**: 3D fault surface generation.
- **Horizon Gridding**: Surface generation from picks.
- **Structural Grids**: Corner-point grid generation logic.

### 5. Property Modeling (Phase 6)
- **Geostatistics**: Kriging and SGS for property distribution (Porosity, Permeability).
- **Volumetrics**: STOIP and GRV calculations.
- **Uncertainty**: Monte Carlo simulation hooks.

### 6. Advanced Integration (Phase 7)
- **Unified Data Model**: Centralized health and consistency checks.
- **Sync Engine**: Real-time state propagation across modules.
- **Collaboration**: Team chat and change tracking.

## Optimization Strategies

### Performance
- **Lazy Loading**: All major views are code-split to reduce initial bundle size.
- **WebGL**: 3D rendering via `@react-three/fiber` ensures GPU acceleration.
- **Virtualization**: Large lists (logs, table data) are virtualized.

### Database
- **Supabase**: Uses RLS (Row Level Security) for robust access control.
- **Indexing**: Queries are optimized for project-scoped fetching.

## Developer Guide

### Adding a New Module
1. Create the view component in `src/components/subsurface-studio/`.
2. Register the lazy load import in `src/pages/apps/EarthModelStudio.jsx`.
3. Add a TabTrigger in the main layout.
4. Hook into `StudioContext` for shared state.

### Security
- All writes must verify project ownership via RLS policies.
- Use `useAuth` context for user identification.
