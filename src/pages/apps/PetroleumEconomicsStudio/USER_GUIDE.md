## Introduction
Welcome to the Petroleum Economics Studio. This application is designed to help engineers, economists, and managers evaluate the financial viability of upstream assets.

## Project Setup
Navigate to the **Projects** list to create a new evaluation.
- Click **New Project**
- Enter Project Name, Country, and Type.
- Once created, click "Open Workspace".

## Data Input
The workspace is divided into logical tabs:
- **Setup**: Define global parameters (Discount Rate, Inflation).
- **Production**: Enter yearly volumes. You can copy-paste from Excel.
- **Costs**: Enter CAPEX (Drilling, Facilities) and OPEX (Fixed, Variable).
- **Assumptions**: Use the right-hand panel to set working interest and uptime.

## Fiscal Modeling
The **Fiscal Tab** allows you to model:
- **Royalty/Tax Systems**: Standard tax regimes.
- **PSCs**: Production Sharing Contracts with cost recovery and profit splits.
- **Joint Ventures**: Equity splits.

## Analysis & Results
- **Dashboard**: View high-level KPIs (NPV, IRR, DPI).
- **Cashflow**: Inspect the detailed annual cashflow waterfall (Revenue -> Tax -> NCF).
- **Charts**: Interactive plots for production and cashflow profiles.

## Scenarios & Sensitivity
- **Scenarios**: Clone your Base Case to create "High Capex" or "Low Price" sensitivities. Compare them in the Scenarios tab.
- **Sensitivity**: Run a Tornado chart to see which variables impact NPV the most.

## Reporting & Export
- **PDF**: Generate a standardized investment memo.
- **Excel**: Export the full model for offline analysis.
- **Integration**: Send snapshots to the FDP Accelerator for field development planning.
