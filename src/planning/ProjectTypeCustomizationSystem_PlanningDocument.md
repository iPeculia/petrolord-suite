    *   **Risk Profile:** (e.g., "All High Risks mitigated to Medium or Low").
*   **Sign-off:** Define who (by role or individual) must sign off on each criterion or the gate as a whole.

### 6c. Define Gate-Specific Risks and Issues
*   Associated with each gate are common risks and potential issues.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **FID Gate:** Risk of "Cost Overrun", Issue of "Regulatory Delay".

## 7. Task Customization

### 7a. Define Task Templates Per Project Type
*   A library of predefined tasks for various project types and stages.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Exploration:** "Acquire new seismic data", "Interpret well logs", "Run volumetric calculations".
    *   **Drilling:** "Prepare AFE for drilling", "Design casing string", "Conduct anti-collision review".
    *   **Facilities:** "Perform HAZOP study", "Prepare P&ID drawings", "Develop commissioning procedures".
*   **Customization:** Users can select tasks from templates or create new ones. The "Task Template Dialog" in `InputPanel.jsx` already supports this.

    *   **Example:** "Run volumetric calculations" depends on "Interpret well logs".
*   **Customization:** Users can graphically define and manage task dependencies within the Gantt chart or WBS view.

### 7c. Define Task Resource Requirements
*   Each task template can suggest required resources.
*   **Examples:**
    *   "Seismic Interpretation": Geophysicist, Seismologist.
    *   "Casing Design": Drilling Engineer.
*   **Customization:** Users can assign specific resources (from the resource pool) to tasks, define allocation (e.g., 50% time for 2 weeks), and specify roles.

### 7d. Define Task Duration Estimates
*   Task templates will include typical duration estimates.
*   **Customization:** Users can adjust duration estimates based on project specifics. Integrate with historical data/AI for improved estimation.

## 8. Risk Customization

### 8a. Define Risk Categories Per Project Type
*   **Default Categories:** Technical, Operational, Commercial, Regulatory, HSE, Environmental.
*   **Project-Specific Categories:** Users can define custom categories relevant to their specific project type.
*   **Example:** For CCUS projects, add "Geological Containment Risk", "Carbon Market Risk".

### 8b. Define Typical Risks Per Stage
*   A library of common risks associated with specific stages within project types.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Exploration: Drilling Stage:** "Lost Circulation", "Stuck Pipe", "Formation Fluid Contamination".
    *   **Field Development: Construction Stage:** "Delay in equipment delivery", "Labor disputes", "Adverse weather impact".
*   **Customization:** Users can browse and select common risks, or define unique risks for their project.

### 8c. Define Risk Probability/Impact Scales
*   **Standard Scales:**
    *   **Probability:** (1-5 scale) Rare, Unlikely, Moderate, Likely, Almost Certain.
    *   **Impact:** (1-5 scale) Insignificant, Minor, Moderate, Major, Catastrophic.
*   **Customization:** Allow modification of scale definitions, labels, and associated numerical values to match organizational standards. The `RiskForm.jsx` already uses 1-5 scales.

### 8d. Define Risk Response Strategies
*   For each identified risk, suggest common response strategies.
*   **Examples:** Avoid, Mitigate, Transfer, Accept.
*   **Mitigation Plan Templates:** For typical risks (e.g., "Stuck Pipe"), provide templated mitigation plans that can be adapted.

## 9. Resource Customization

### 9a. Define Discipline Requirements Per Project Type
*   Each project type will come with a predefined list of core disciplines required.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Exploration:** Geologist, Geophysicist, Petrophysicist.
    *   **Facilities:** Process Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Project Engineer.
*   **Customization:** Users can define additional disciplines or modify existing ones.

### 9b. Define Skill Requirements Per Stage
*   For critical roles or stages, specific skills can be defined.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Geophysicist:** Seismic interpretation, attribute analysis, depth conversion.
    *   **Drilling Engineer:** Well design, anti-collision, hydraulics, torque & drag.
*   **Customization:** Users can specify a list of required skills for a role or for tasks within a stage. The `ResourceForm.jsx` already allows adding skills.

### 9c. Define Team Structure Templates
*   Predefined organizational charts or team structures for different project types.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Small Well Intervention Team: Well Eng, Production Tech, Operations Supervisor.
    *   Large FDP Team: Project Director, Discipline Leads (Subsurface, Drilling, Facilities), Project Services.
*   **Customization:** Users can modify the template, add new roles, or adjust reporting lines.

### 9d. Define Resource Allocation Patterns
*   Default allocation percentages or FTE equivalents for different roles across project stages.
*   **Example:** Project Manager: 100% throughout; Drilling Engineer: 20% in Concept, 80% in Drilling Stage.
*   **Customization:** Allow adjusting these patterns to optimize workload and cost.
